A set of statistical tools intended for the setting in which we have only a set of features measured on $n$ observations. We are not interested in prediction, since we do not really know what to predict given no labels (no associated response $Y$). Rather, the goal is to discover interesting things about the measurements (features). 

Is there an informative way to visualize the data? Can we discover subgroups among the observations? Unsupervised learning refers to a diverse set of techniques for answering questions as these.  

Unsupervised learning is often performed as a part of exploratory data analysis. it can be hard to assess the results obtained from unsupervised learning methods, since there is no universally accepted mechanism for performing cross-validation or validating results on an independent data set.
