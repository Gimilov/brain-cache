This note encapsulates my thoughts based on Internet research about how to read papers efficiently.

IMPORTANT: **As you read more, it'll become more natural.**
- with time, you should learn to differentiate between important and less important details (as it relates to your field)


1. **Set Goals**: Know why you're reading—reviewing, surveying, or understanding for research.
2. **First Pass**:  
   - Skim title, abstract, intro, conclusion, headings, and figures.  
   - Answer: What’s the paper about? Relevant? Clear? Key contributions?  
3. **Second Pass**: 
   - Read carefully, focusing on key points and evidence, skipping detailed proofs.  
   - Analyze graphs, **note unfamiliar terms**, and summarize main ideas.  Go back to what you didn't understand later.
4. **Third Pass**:  
   - Dive deep for full understanding.  
   - Recreate the work, challenge assumptions, evaluate methods, and identify strengths, weaknesses, and gaps.  
5. **Make Notes**: Write down questions, key takeaways, and highlights for later reference.  
6. **Summarize**: Condense the paper into 1-2 sentences and outline key subpoints.
