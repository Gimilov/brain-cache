VGG16 is basically a simple and widely used convnet. Even though it is from 2014, therefore far from the current state of the art, it is an architecture that is very similar to what we have seen with vanilla CNNs. Moreover, it is exceptionally easy to understand without introducing any new concepts. The architecture was trained on the ImageNet dataset (1.4 million labelled images and 1000 different classes).
