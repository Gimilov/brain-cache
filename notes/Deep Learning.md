As humans we tend to process types of data that not so much time ago was regarded as impossible for a machine to analyse. Human eye can perceive an image and an ear can hear the sound. Before the researchers have focused on the developments of various neural network architectures, there was no pattern-recognising method available for processing such types of data.

*A mathematical framework for learning representations from data, going through a series of information distillation processes.* **A** **representation** is a different way of looking at the data. **Learning** is an automatic search process for better representations.

| The **deep** in deep learning is the idea of **succesive layers of representations** |
| :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |

Therefore, the ML techniques we've seen so far are *shallow* learners. 
*"Deep learning is a mathematical framework for learning representations from data (â€¦) a **multi-staged** **information-distilliation** operation, where information goes through **successive filters** and comes out **increasingly purified**"*

No... deep learning models are NOT models of the brain...
